# USC_ISE_529 Predictive Analytics

## Module 1 : Introduction to Predictive Analytics


## Module 2 : Data Preparation and Visualization

1. Attribute types  
-Categories:  
Nominal =, <>  
Ordinal =, <>, <, >  
-Measures:  
Interval =, <>, <, >, +/-  
Eg: Temperature  
Ratio =, <>, <, >, +/-, *, /, (meaning full zero point)  
Eg: Age, Length, Mass  

2. Relational vs dimensional data structures  
Relational:  
A. Designed for optimized read/update/delete processing of individual transactions  
B. “Normalized” data model eliminates redundant data  
C. Because there is no redundant data, there is no possibility of inconsistencies  
Dimensional:  
A. Designed for optimized summarization and filtering of large numbers of transactions  
B. “Denormalized” data model allows significant redundancy as a tradeoff for analytics and reporting efficiency  
C. Easier for analyst to understand  
  
 
 
3. Tidy data formats

4. Joining data

5. Handling missing and noisy data

6. Techniques for univariate and bivariate analysis  
PPT 141

7. Correlation matrix interpretation

8. Selecting attributes to include in analytic dataset


## Module 3 : Modeling Introduction 

1. Residuals - definition and interpretation
2. Over-fitting - definition and application
3. Model assessment metrics (MSE/R2)
4. Bias/Variance - definition and application
5. KNN algorithm

## Module 4 : Linear Methods for Regression

1. Ordinary Least Squares(OLS)
2. Model assessment metrics
3. Handling categorical predictores
4. Nonlinearities - detection and handling
5. Interation effects - detection and handling
6. Comparing regression models
7. Interpreting P-values of T statistics and F statistics
8. Interpreting regression coefficients

## Module 5 : Linear Methods for Classification

1. Odds ratios
The odds ratio (or just odds) is an expression of how much more likely an event is to occure than not occur.  
2. Interpreting coefficients

3. Maximum likelihood estimation

4. Confounding

5. Misclassification rates

6. Sensitivity/specificity

7. ROC charts - definition and interpretaion

8. Lift curves - definition and interpretaion
